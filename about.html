I am Mohamed M.Habib, also known as Doublepicebs. I am 14-year-old dude who loves programming in HTML, Kotlin and Python. Recently I decided to make a blog with wordpress, then I said "why wordpress? I could
code my own!" and then I decided coding my hand-made blog on June 18, 2019. And what a nice experience it is !
