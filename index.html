Designing the new site
</h2>
<!--Post Content-->
<div class="post-content">
<p>
We (I mean I,) made a new total re-design for the blog, making it dark themed and making
the font bigger, of course that wasn't easy to fix two-days-resulted bugs. Fixing and redesigning the site
was harder than creating it, because, well I made the redesign (which is actually a new file from scratch) and coding
it totally myself, as the 2 previous blog was guided by the online course, I could say it was easier ti create it myself
because I know why I do each step. Unlike the course guide, it tells me to write the code and then tells why with many extra and unnecessary code.
Whatsoever, I'll add bigger-blog support soon to prevent the internet consumption. The best thing consumers see about hand-made blogs is that they mostly dont
contain cookies or extra stuff that consumes internet without need. See ya later with big blog support soon !

Testing 2 publishers
</h2>
<!--Post Content-->
<div class="post-content">
<p>
Here, we tried testing the brand new multi-publisher
algorithm. Look, it's a human algorithm, which means the 
publisher should write the code himself then sends it. Seems unproductive,
but I will change that as soon as possible with an app
that automatically writes the code and gives you the file to publish it.
That will help with longer posts and easier image embeds ! btw, I am not a bot
catter is just Doublepicebs trying the new multi-publisher algorithm.
Thanks, and dont forget to like me on Twitter and share this post.
(pst.. I will put a share post button later)
