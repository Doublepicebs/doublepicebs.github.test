<p>
June 18, 2019 was the date I started working on my real hand-made coded blog. I sat and started coding the html
files first. Really I was looking forward programming especially html and Python. However, the blog started with a bad design and colours, but everything should be fine, shouldn't it ?
</p>
<p>
However the blog progress was amazing, in 2 hours I nearly finished the html basics of the main page ! Let's keep JS and CSS for later ! I really need some YouTube rest. Coming to you, Daheh !!
Oh, check al-Daheh on youtube btw. I dont have a link to his channel now, so I'll put it later in another post.!
